# What I've learnt


http://practicaltypography.com/maxims-of-page-layout.html


1. Start with the most important section (body text?) then build the other sections around

2. Divide the page into fore­ground (important) and background (not so). Don’t let the back­ground el­e­ments up­stage the fore­ground el­e­ments.

3. Make ad­just­ments with the small­est vis­i­ble increments. Typography thrives on fine de­tails. The difference be­tween not enough and too much can be small.

4. Be consistent. Things that are the same should look the same. Things that look different should ac­tu­al­ly be different.

5. Relate each new el­e­ment to ex­ist­ing elements. The only time you have un­fet­tered dis­cre­tion is when the page is blank. After that, the page is like a jig­saw puz­zle that be­comes more con­strained with each new piece.

6. Keep it simple.

7. Don’t fear white space.




# TLDR;

* Body text is the most important, they are the most visible and take the biggest share of the page

* What matters most is (1-3. is basically Iain's Typograph):

  1. Font size: 15-25px
  
  2. Line height: 120-145% of font size
  
  3. Text width: 45-90 characters
  
  4. Fonts, colors: Low­er con­trast can be more effective than high­er con­trast

* Other important rules:

  5. Avoid goofy fonts: Novelty fonts, script fonts, hand­writ­ing fonts, cir­cus fonts
  
  6. Avoid monospace fonts: Courier etc...
  
  7. Avoid system fonts: 
  
    * Never use Times and Arial. They are used by rookies
    
    * System fonts are optimized for screen, not also for _print_
    
    * When necessary to use themconsult this list: http://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html
    
  8. Never use underlining, un­less it’s a hyperlink.
  
  9. Use cen­tered text sparingly.
  
    * Centered text is ac­cept­able when used for short phras­es or titles, like the name on your busi­ness cards or letterhead.
  
  10. Bold and italic: One or the oth­er, as lit­tle as possible
  
  11. Small caps: Use 5–12% ex­tra space with caps, but not with lowercase
  
  12. Kerning (bring closer those letters which belongs together lik 'Ty', 'Gy' ...) allways on:
  
    * in CSS <text-ren­der­ing: optimizeLegibility>, and en­able the open­type feature kern
    
    * http://practicaltypography.com/kerning.html
    
  13. Justify: web browsers can't really do it, so avoid
  
  14. Hypens and dashes:
  
    * Hyphen (-) is to connect or separate words like quasi-hyperreal
    
    * En dash (&ndash;) is two hypens, and is used to indicate range of values like 1990&ndash;1999
    
    * Em dash (&mdash;) is three hypens, used to break between parts of a sentence. It is used when:
    
      * a comma is too weak
      
      * colon, semicolon, parantheses are too strong
      
      
# Philosophy

* Typography is for the benefit of the reader, not the writer.

* You’re not read­ing it for the same rea­sons as your read­er | Nobody reads your text | Spare/Drive your visitors attention

* Good ty­pog­ra­phy can help your read­er de­vote less at­ten­tion to the me­chan­ics of read­ing and more at­ten­tion to your _mes­sage_.

* Your abil­i­ty to pro­duce good ty­pog­ra­phy de­pends on how well you un­der­stand the goals of your text, not on taste or vi­su­al train­ing.

* Typography is pri­mar­i­ly utilitarian then an artis­tic or aes­thet­ic pur­suit. 

    Typography that is aes­thet­i­cal­ly pleas­ant, but that doesn’t re­in­force the mean­ing of the text, is a fail­ure. Typography that re­in­forces the mean­ing of the text, even if aes­thet­i­cal­ly un­pleas­ant, is a success. 
    Does that mean that effective ty­pog­ra­phy can be ugly? Sure. Sometimes ugly is bet­ter than pretty.
    
    
* There’s more to text for­mat­ting than what font to use

* Learn the basics and you’ll need to start mak­ing ty­po­graph­ic judg­ments of your own.


# Headings

* Fewer lev­els, sub­tler emphasis

* Multiple lev­els of headings present two sets of prob­lems: struc­tur­al and ty­po­graph­ic. Cure the struc­tur­al prob­lems (presented below) and the ty­po­graph­ic prob­lems be­come much simpler.

## 1. Too many levels of heading

* Headings are sign­posts for read­ers that re­veal the struc­ture of your *ar­gu­ment*. Note that I didn’t say the struc­ture of your document. 

* Limit your­self to three lev­els of head­ings. Two is bet­ter. Readers should be able to ori­ent them­selves from the head­ings. With more than three lev­els, that task be­comes hope­less­ly con­fus­ing. You may know your ar­gu­ment in­side out, but no one else does.
  
## 2. Write sub­stan­tive head­ings

* Head­ings are not place­hold­ers or la­bels. Readers should be able to un­der­stand the frame­work of your ar­gu­ment just by read­ing the head­ings.

* Headings with­out sub­stance are not sign­posts—they just waste space.

## Rules

1. All caps are fine for head­ings short­er than one line, but oth­er­wise avoid them.

2. And Always Avoid Title Case, Because Your Headings Aren’t Titles.

3. Don’t un­der­line.

4. Don’t cen­ter, sub­ject to the ex­cep­tions in cen­tered text.

5. The best way to em­pha­size a head­ing is by putting space above and below, be­cause it’s both sub­tle and effective.

6. Use bold, not ital­ic. Non-bold head­ings work too.

7. You can make the point size big­ger, but just a lit­tle.


# Fonts

* Most doc­u­ments can tol­er­ate a sec­ond font; many few­er can tol­er­ate a third; al­most none can tol­er­ate four or more.

* You can mix any two fonts that are vis­i­bly different. If you’ve heard you can only mix a serif font with a sans serif font, it’s not true.

* Low­er con­trast be­tween fonts can be more effective than high­er con­trast

* Each font has a con­sis­tent role in the doc­u­ment

* Mix fonts by the same font de­sign­er

  

# Colors and Contrast

* In a page of text, noth­ing draws the eye more pow­er­ful­ly than a con­trast be­tween light and dark col­ors. This is why a bold font cre­ates more em­pha­sis than an ital­ic font.

* A thin or small font can take a more in­tense col­or than a heavy or large font. The per­ceived in­ten­si­ty of col­ored type de­pends not just on the col­or, but also the size and weight of the font.

* Multiple shades of one col­or are usu­al­ly bet­ter than mul­ti­ple con­trast­ing colors.

* The hu­man eye can more eas­i­ly dis­tin­guish light col­ors than dark. 

* Red has been the fa­vored sec­ond col­or in ty­pog­ra­phy for hun­dreds of years. To get the most vi­brant-look­ing red, use an old print­er’s trick—make it slight­ly orange.



# Page elements



## Blockquote

1. Reduce the point size and line spacing slightly.

2. Indent the text block be­tween half an inch and a full inch on the left side, and op­tion­al­ly the same on the right. Or on the web, about 2–5 ems.


## Lines (rules) and Borders

* Like cen­tered text, bold or italic, and all caps, rules and bor­ders are best used spar­ing­ly.

* Don’t use pat­terned bor­ders (i.e., bor­ders made of any­thing oth­er than a sin­gle sol­id line, like dots, dash­es, or dou­ble lines). They’re un­nec­es­sar­i­ly complicated.

* If you at­tach a rule to headings, try putting it above the head­ing (rather than be­low, which is usu­al­ly the de­fault). Then the rule is sep­a­rat­ing the end of the pre­vi­ous sec­tion from the cur­rent head­ing, in­stead of sep­a­rat­ing the cur­rent head­ing from its own section.
